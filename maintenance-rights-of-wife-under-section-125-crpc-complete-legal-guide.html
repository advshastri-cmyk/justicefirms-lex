  <main>
    <p>Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 is one of India's most powerful social justice provisions. It provides a quick, affordable, and secular remedy to prevent vagrancy and destitution by compelling a person with sufficient means to maintain his wife, children, and parents.</p>

    <h2>Who Can Claim Maintenance under Section 125?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Wife</strong>: Includes legally wedded wife (even if separated/divorced but not remarried)</li>
      <li><strong>Minor children</strong>: Legitimate or illegitimate</li>
      <li><strong>Adult children</strong>: Unable to maintain due to disability</li>
      <li><strong>Parents</strong>: If unable to maintain themselves</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Conditions for Wife to Claim Maintenance</h2>
    <p>A wife can claim if:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>She is unable to maintain herself</li>
      <li>Husband has sufficient means but neglects/refuses</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Exceptions (when claim can be denied):</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Wife living in adultery</li>
      <li>Wife refuses to live with husband without sufficient cause</li>
      <li>Wife living separately by mutual consent</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Procedure to File Petition</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>File application before Judicial Magistrate (1st Class) in whose jurisdiction parties reside</li>
      <li>No court fee required (very low cost)</li>
      <li>Interim maintenance can be granted during pendency</li>
      <li>Enforcement through attachment of salary/property or even imprisonment</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Quantum of Maintenance – Factors Considered</h2>
    <p>Courts consider:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Husband's income & lifestyle</li>
      <li>Wife's needs & standard of living</li>
      <li>Number of dependents</li>
      <li>Inflation (2026 context – courts often award 25-40% of net income)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Important Supreme Court Judgments</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Badshah vs Urmila (2014)</strong>: Liberal interpretation; even second wife can claim in some cases</li>
      <li><strong>Bhagwan Dutt vs Kamla Devi (1975)</strong>: Maintenance should be reasonable</li>
      <li><strong>Rajathi vs C. Ganesan (1999)</strong>: Interim maintenance mandatory in most cases</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2025-2026 Updates & Trends</h2>
    <p>With rising living costs, courts are increasingly awarding higher interim amounts (₹15,000–₹50,000+ pm depending on income). Digital filing and video hearings have made process faster in many districts.</p>

    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Section 125 CrPC remains the fastest remedy for financial security of neglected family members. It is secular, summary, and enforceable. Consult a lawyer immediately if facing neglect – delay can weaken your case.</p>
