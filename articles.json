    "content": "<h3>Introduction to Section 125 CrPC</h3><p>Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (now Section 144 of BNSS 2023) is a social welfare provision designed to prevent vagrancy and destitution by ensuring that certain dependent family members are financially supported. It provides a speedy, inexpensive remedy for wives, minor children, disabled adult children, and aged parents who are unable to maintain themselves.</p><h3>Who Can Claim Maintenance?</h3><p>A wife (including a divorced wife who has not remarried) can claim maintenance if she is unable to maintain herself. The term 'wife' includes a woman who has been divorced but not remarried. Importantly, the provision is religion-neutral and applies to all communities.</p><h3>Grounds for Refusal</h3><p>The husband can defend the claim if he proves that the wife is living in adultery, or has refused to live with him without sufficient reason, or they are living separately by mutual consent. However, mere allegations are not enough — concrete evidence is required.</p><h3>Calculation of Maintenance Amount</h3><p>There is no fixed formula, but courts consider:</p><ul><li>Husband's income, assets, and liabilities</li><li>Wife's needs, lifestyle during marriage, and reasonable expenses</li><li>Children's education and medical costs (if claimed together)</li><li>Inflation and cost of living</li></ul><p>In recent judgments (2024–2025), Supreme Court has emphasized that maintenance should enable the wife to live with dignity at the same standard as during marriage. Courts are awarding 20–33% of husband's net salary in many cases.</p><h3>Interim Maintenance</h3><p>Under Section 125(1) proviso, courts can grant interim maintenance from the date of application. This is crucial to prevent financial hardship during prolonged proceedings.</p><h3>Enforcement Mechanisms</h3><p>If the husband defaults:</p><ul><li>Recovery through salary attachment</li><li>Seizure and sale of movable/immovable property</li><li>Issuance of arrest warrant</li><li>Imprisonment up to 1 month per default</li></ul><p>Arrears can be recovered even after years, subject to limitation.</p><h3>Recent Landmark Judgments (2024–2025)</h3><p>The Supreme Court in <em>Rajnesh vs Neha</em> (2020) guidelines continue to be followed strictly. Courts now mandate affidavits of income, assets, and expenditure from both parties. Working wives are not automatically denied maintenance if their income is insufficient for dignified living.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Section 125 remains one of the most powerful tools for financial protection of dependent family members. It is meant to be a shield, not a sword, and courts are increasingly balancing both parties' rights while prioritizing welfare.</p><p><strong>If you are facing a maintenance claim or need to file one, early legal consultation is crucial for proper documentation and strategy.</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://justicefirms.com/contact\">Book Consultation with Adv.

    "content": "<h3>परिचय: धारा 498A का महत्व और दुरुपयोग</h3><p>भारतीय दंड संहिता की धारा 498A वर्ष 1983 में महिलाओं को पति और ससुराल वालों द्वारा दहेज के लिए क्रूरता से बचाने के लिए जोड़ी गई थी। यह धारा गैर-जमानती और संज्ञेय है, अर्थात पुलिस बिना वारंट गिरफ्तार कर सकती है। अपराध की सजा 3 वर्ष तक की कैद और जुर्माना है।</p><p>हालांकि, सुप्रीम कोर्ट ने कई निर्णयों में इस धारा के दुरुपयोग को चिह्नित किया है। अर्जुन रामपाल बनाम राज्य (2014) और हाल के 2024-2025 मामलों में कोर्ट ने कहा कि यह धारा 'कानूनी आतंकवाद' का रूप ले रही है, जहां सामान्य वैवाहिक विवादों को आपराधिक मामला बना दिया जाता है। परिणामस्वरूप, 498A में फंसे व्यक्तियों की पहली चिंता जमानत होती है।</p><p>यह लेख 498A में जमानत की पूरी प्रक्रिया, रणनीति, और क्लाइंट्स के सबसे आम प्रश्नों का विस्तृत उत्तर देगा।</p><h3>अग्रिम जमानत की संभावना और आधार</h3><p>धारा 438 CrPC (BNSS में धारा 482) के तहत गिरफ्तारी से पहले अग्रिम जमानत ली जा सकती है। 498A में अग्रिम जमानत मिलने की उच्च संभावना रहती है क्योंकि:</p><ul><li>आरोप अक्सर सामान्य और अस्पष्ट होते हैं (कोई विशिष्ट घटना, तारीख या स्थान नहीं)</li><li>FIR में वर्षों की देरी (विवाह के 5-10 साल बाद)</li><li>पहले से तलाक की कार्यवाही या अलगाव</li><li>शिकायत का मकसद संपत्ति या बच्चे की कस्टडी हासिल करना</li><li>आरोपी का कोई पूर्व आपराधिक रिकॉर्ड नहीं</li></ul><p>सुप्रीम कोर्ट ने प्रीति गुप्ता बनाम राज्य (2010) और हाल के निर्णयों में कहा कि जहां दुरुपयोग स्पष्ट हो, अग्रिम जमानत दी जानी चाहिए ताकि व्यक्ति की स्वतंत्रता और सम्मान सुरक्षित रहे।</p><h3>अग्रिम जमानत आवेदन की तैयारी और दस्तावेज</h3><p>आवेदन मजबूत बनाने के लिए:</p><ol><li>आरोपों की सामान्यता पर जोर दें</li><li>शिकायतकर्ता के पिछले व्यवहार का प्रमाण (चैट्स, ईमेल, तलाक नोटिस)</li><li>समझौता या मध्यस्थता के प्रयासों का उल्लेख</li><li>आरोपी की सामाजिक स्थिति (नौकरी, परिवार, स्थायी पता)</li><li>जांच में पूर्ण सहयोग का वादा</li></ol><p>महत्वपूर्ण दस्तावेज: विवाह प्रमाणपत्र, FIR कॉपी, WhatsApp चैट्स, मध्यस्थता रिकॉर्ड, आय प्रमाण।</p><h3>नियमित जमानत यदि गिरफ्तारी हो जाए</h3><p>गिरफ्तारी के बाद धारा 437 (मजिस्ट्रेट) या 439 (सत्र/हाई कोर्ट) के तहत नियमित जमानत आवेदन करें। मुख्य आधार:</p><ul><li>जांच लगभग पूरी, कोई सबूत छेड़छाड़ का खतरा नहीं</li><li>आरोपी समाज में जड़े जमाए (फरार होने की संभावना शून्य)</li><li>महिला, वृद्ध या बीमार आरोपी को प्राथमिकता</li><li>मुकदमा वर्षों चलेगा, हिरासत अनावश्यक</li></ul><p>हाई कोर्ट अक्सर 498A में शीघ्र जमानत दे देता है।</p><h3>FIR रद्द कराना – सबसे प्रभावी समाधान</h3><p>धारा 482 CrPC के तहत हाई कोर्ट में क्वाशिंग पिटिशन दाखिल करें। भजन लाल मामले के सिद्धांत:</p><ul><li>कोई अपराध प्रथम दृष्टया नहीं बनता</li><li>आरोप असंभव और अविश्वसनीय</li><li>दुर्भावना स्पष्ट</li><li>सिविल विवाद को आपराधिक रंग</li><li>समझौता हो चुका</li></ul><p>2025 में दिल्ली, बॉम्बे, इलाहाबाद हाई कोर्ट ने सैकड़ों FIR रद्द कीं जहां समझौता या सामान्य आरोप थे।</p><h3>क्लाइंट्स के 15+ सामान्य प्रश्न और उत्तर</h3><p><strong>1. 498A में कितने दिन में अग्रिम जमानत मिल जाती है?</strong><br>आवेदन दाखिल के 7-15 दिन में सुनवाई, आदेश 2-6 सप्ताह में।</p><p><strong>2. सास-ननद को भी जमानत मिल सकती है?</strong><br>हां, महिलाओं को अक्सर आसानी से मिल जाती है, क्योंकि आरोप दूरस्थ होते हैं।</p><p><strong>3. जमानत पर क्या शर्तें लगती हैं?</strong><br>पीड़िता से संपर्क न करना, जांच में शामिल होना, पासपोर्ट जमा, स्थानीय पुलिस स्टेशन रिपोर्टिंग।</p><p><strong>4. समझौता होने पर क्या करें?</strong><br>समझौता पत्र नोटरी करवाएं और हाई कोर्ट में क्वाशिंग पिटिशन दाखिल – 3-6 महीने में FIR रद्द।</p><p><strong>5. लागत कितनी?</strong><br>अग्रिम जमानत: 50,000-1,50,000 रुपये। क्वाशिंग: 1,50,000-3,00,000 रुपये।</p><p><strong>6. सुप्रीम कोर्ट से सीधे अग्रिम जमानत?</strong><br>संभव लेकिन दुर्लभ;
