  <main>
    <p>Section 52A of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (NDPS Act) is one of the most important procedural safeguards introduced to balance effective enforcement against the rights of the accused. Introduced through amendment in 1989 and further strengthened by the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (Seizure, Storage, Sampling and Disposal) Rules, 2022 (GSR 899E), this section mandates a structured process for handling seized contraband to prevent tampering, substitution, or loss of evidence.</p>

    <h2>Why was Section 52A Introduced?</h2>
    <p>Narcotic substances are highly vulnerable to theft, substitution, or degradation. Long-term storage in police malkhanas often leads to evidentiary issues in trials. Section 52A allows early disposal (after due process) while preserving the chain of custody through mandatory judicial oversight.</p>

    <h2>Key Provisions of Section 52A</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Sub-section (1):</strong> Central Government may notify hazardous/vulnerable substances for early disposal.</li>
      <li><strong>Sub-section (2):</strong> Seizing officer prepares detailed inventory and applies to Magistrate for:
        <ul>
          <li>Certification of inventory</li>
          <li>Photography in Magistrate's presence</li>
          <li>Drawing representative samples in Magistrate's presence</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Sub-section (3):</strong> Magistrate shall allow application promptly.</li>
      <li><strong>Sub-section (4):</strong> Certified inventory, photos, and samples become primary evidence (even overriding Evidence Act/CrPC provisions in some aspects).</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>2022 Rules – Detailed Sampling Guidelines</h2>
    <p>The 2022 Rules provide specific quantities for representative samples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Heroin/Cocaine – 5 grams per packet</li>
      <li>Opium/Ganja/Charas – 24 grams</li>
      <li>Poppy Straw – 100 grams</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Samples must be drawn in duplicate from each identical package/container. The Magistrate must certify the process.</p>

    <h2>Supreme Court Guidelines & Landmark Judgments</h2>
    <p>In recent judgments (2024-2025), the Supreme Court has emphasized:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Samples should preferably be drawn in accused's presence (though not mandatory at seizure spot)</li>
      <li>Substantial compliance is enough; minor procedural lapses don't vitiate trial unless prejudice is shown</li>
      <li>Inventory + photos + samples in Magistrate presence = strong primary evidence</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Practical Steps for Compliance (Checklist for Officers)</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Prepare detailed inventory immediately after seizure</li>
      <li>File application before Magistrate u/s 52A(2)</li>
      <li>Conduct photography & sampling in open court/Magistrate presence</li>
      <li>Get certification on samples/inventory/photos</li>
      <li>Preserve samples securely for FSL testing</li>
      <li>Apply for disposal if notified substance (after trial or per rules)</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Common Mistakes Leading to Acquittals</h2>
    <p>Many acquittals happen due to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>No Magistrate involvement in sampling</li>
      <li>Mixing samples from different packets</li>
      <li>Delay in sending samples to FSL</li>
      <li>Missing certification on inventory</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Section 52A and 2022 Rules have made India's narcotics enforcement more transparent and evidence-proof. Proper compliance ensures speedy disposal without compromising prosecution. Legal practitioners and enforcement agencies must treat this as mandatory procedural law rather than directory.</p>
